# Black Board Project
This is a full stack application that allows user to create, read, update and delete
the board. This application allows user to sign-up with an e-mail and password. The
password is hashed by the hash password scripts for security purpose. Once signed in the user
can upload, edit, and delete boards from their account.The board consists of board name, topic
and description:

Example:
Board Name: History
Topic: US Presidents
Description: Today we will learn who were the previous presidents in USA.

Once the board is created it is added to user`s board folder so user can be able to see
all the boards that is created by him. When the board is created, this board also can be seen
by other users and the board can be commented by other users.(comment field is not added on
board yet. The future of board is still under progress)

The board also has creatin data and time. All the boards are shown under "All Boards" tab
and "My Boards" tab is with in a chornological order, with the most recent item at the top of the list.

User also able to delete and update the board. Once the user clicks the my board tab, he is able to
see his created boards. There is an action button under the board which allows user to delete and update
the board. Once the button is clicked, the user is able to update the boardName, topic and
description fileds. Once the board is updated, the board creation date and time will be updated as
updated date and time.

## Planning Story

The first step in the process of planning the site was to identify the functionality of the site
based on requirements and the user stories.I created an ERD and discussed the user experience.
I developed wireframs for the layout I wanted to use.

This plan is essentialy inspired by the basic forum website to help people to discuss on the problems or
projects. At the same time the black board can be used for teachers or authors who whould like to
teach and publish his lesson or description about the book.
